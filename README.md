Here is what you should know about be:

- üñ•Ô∏è I have been working as a software engineer for 3 years in agile fast-growing companies
- üíΩ I am passionate about database internals and distributed systems
- üìö I have an insatiable thirst for learning
- ü§Ø I love solving complex problems
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë I genuinely care for others & love helping and teaching
- ‚õ∞Ô∏è I am an outdoor sports enthusiast

I have a blog where I share my learnings about software internals. You can check it out

## Some of the projects I did during my free-time

I love understanding how things work under the hood.
I found that re-implementing the systems I am interested in from scratch really helps me deepen my understanding of
those.
Here are the ones I have built from scratch so far:

- [PebbleDB](https://github.com/MaudGautier/pebbledb): a persistent key-value store based on an LSM-tree. It
  mimics [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/).
- [Pytcask](https://github.com/MaudGautier/pytcask): a key-value store based on a log-structured hash table. It
  mimics [Bitcask](https://github.com/basho/bitcask).
- [Metamorphostreams](https://github.com/MaudGautier/metamorphostreams): an event-streaming platform. It
  mimics [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).
- [Express-auth](https://github.com/MaudGautier/express-auth): a basic user/password authentication app I made to
  understand how authentication works.
- [Custom-React-UI-library](https://github.com/MaudGautier/custom-React-UI-library): a custom TypeScript library that
  allows to create interactive user interfaces for web applications. It mimics [React](https://react.dev/).
- [Custom-JS-testing-framework](https://github.com/MaudGautier/custom-js-testing-framework): a custom JavaScript testing
  framework that allows to create unit tests. It mimics [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

I also do some challenges, both because they are fun and because they help me learn more about a particular topic:

- [Flyio-distributed-systems-challenges](https://github.com/MaudGautier/flyio-distributed-systems-challenges): My
  solutions to the set of distributed systems challenges developed by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/).
- [Advent-of-code](https://github.com/MaudGautier/advent-of-code): My solutions to
  the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
- [Nand2tetris](https://github.com/MaudGautier/nand2tetris): My solutions to
  the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project.
- [SICP exercises](https://github.com/MaudGautier/sicp-exercises): My solutions to the exercises of
  the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) book](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html).

When I write code, I sometimes come across a behaviour that I did not expect.
I report some of them in a bunch of playground repositories to document these specificities (mostly for my future
self):

- [Python](https://github.com/MaudGautier/python-playground)
- [Postgres](https://github.com/MaudGautier/sql-playground)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/MaudGautier/typescript-playground)
- [React](https://github.com/MaudGautier/react-playground)
- [Go](https://github.com/MaudGautier/go-playground)

## In a previous life

Before becoming a software engineer, I trained as a biologist and eventually spent 5 years doing fundamental research in
academia using bioinformatics methods.
I was particularly interested in evolutionary genomics (a complicated phrasing that basically means "how DNA evolves")
and I did a PhD on this topic (you can find my thesis [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-02435079) and the source
code in [this repo](https://github.com/MaudGautier/PhD-thesis)).
